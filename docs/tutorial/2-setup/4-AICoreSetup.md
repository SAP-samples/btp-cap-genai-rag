#  Setup AI Core (future release)

SAP AI Core is currently not required for this use-case, as partners and customers interested in building LLM scenarios on SAP BTP, must use the SAP-managed **LLM-Proxy Service** offering. Once the **LLM Access Service** is available in public SAP BTP Subaccounts and can be licensed by customers and partners, a transition from the LLM-Proxy Service to the LLM Access Service will be possible.

If you are interested in building a multitenant LLM solution on SAP BTP, leveraging the **LLM-Proxy Service**, please reach out to us using the **paa@sap.com** e-mail address.
