# Test the Application

In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to test the AI Sample application.

1. In a **multitenant** context, please ensure that you subscribed to the AI Sample application as described in the previous chapters ([click here](./1-CreateSubscription.md)). 
   
   > **Hint** - Ideally, you also used the SaaS API to upload and process our sample mails as described in the previous chapter ([click here](./3-PushSampleMails.md)).

2. In a **multitenant** context, please switch to the **Instances and Subscriptions** menu and open the AI SaaS subscription.

   In a **single-tenant** scenario, you can just open the Cloud Foundry Route or Virtual Service of your Application Router.

4. You can now select one of the mails in the list and check out the different features offered by the SaaS sample application.
