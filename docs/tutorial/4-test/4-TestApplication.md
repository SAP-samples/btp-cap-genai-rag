# Test the Application

In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to test the multitenant SaaS application from a SaaS Subscriber perspective. 

1. Please ensure, you subscribed to the application as described in one of the previous chapters ([click here](./1-CreateSubscription.md)). Ideally, you also used the SaaS API to upload and process our sample e-mails as described in the previous chapter ([click here](./3-PushSampleMails.md)).

2. Please switch to the **Instances and Subscriptions** menu and open the AI SaaS subscription.

3. In the application, you will either see the pre-processed sample e-mails or you can upload a new e-mail using the respective upload button. 

4. You can now select one of the e-mails in the list and check out the different features offered by the SaaS sample application.
