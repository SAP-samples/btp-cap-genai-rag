# Deploy the Application

Depending on your target runtime, different deployment steps are required. Please follow the corresponding instructions for your chosen runtime.

- [Deploy the Application](#deploy-the-application)
  - [SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](#sap-btp-kyma-runtime)
  - [SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime](#sap-btp-cloud-foundry-runtime)

## SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

The deployment process in Kyma requires you to use a helm-based deployment approach.

> **Important** - Please ensure you have the respective command line tools installed in your development environment such as **helm**, **Docker** and **kubectl** before you proceed!

> **Hint** - In this tutorial we assume a basic understanding of the Kyma deployment process. If you are not familiar with deployment of Kyma solutions, please refer to our [Multitenant SaaS Sample Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-multitenant-saas/#readme) or follow the respective [SAP Developer Journey](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/deliver-side-by-side-extensibility-based-on-sap-btp-kyma-runtime) to learn the basics and get your setup ready.

1.  Before you start the deployment, please copy and rename to provided **values-private.sample.yaml** file ((single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma/charts) to **values-private.yaml**. This will ensure that your configuration details are not being committed to GitHub by accident.

2.  Pease provide values for the following parameters in your **values-private.yaml** file, based on your own environment and the Container Registry being used.

     <details>
       <summary>global</summary>

    - imagePullSecret - Name of a Image Pull Secret if required.

      > **Hint** - This value needs to contain the reference to a potential Image Pull Secret of your Container Registry. If you're using a free Docker Hub account and public Docker Images, this property can be left unchanged (empty object). Otherwise, the configuration could look similar to the following.

      ```
      imagePullSecret:
        - name : image-pull-secret
      ```

      > You can create the Secret before deploying your application or as part of the Helm deployment process.

    - domain - Your Kyma Cluster default or custom domain.

      > **Hint** - To get the default domain of your Kyma Cluster you can run the following kubectl command.

      ```
      kubectl get configMaps/shoot-info -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.data.domain}'
      ```

      > This will return the required result like _a1b2c3.kyma.ondemand.com_. _a1b2c3_ is a placeholder for a string of characters thatâ€™s unique for your cluster (the so-called **shootName** which we need in the next step).

    - shootName - The unique shoot name of your Kyma Cluster. > **Hint** - To get the **shootName** of your Kyma Cluster, run the following kubectl command.
      `   kubectl get configMaps/shoot-info -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.data.shootName}'`

             > In a productive SAP BTP landscape, your **shootName** will always starts with a letter like *a1b2c3* or with the prefix **c-** like c-1b2c3d4.

      ````sh # Execute in ./multi-tenant/code/broker #
      cd ../../multi-tenant/code/broker # if necessary

          cp catalog.json catalog-private.json

3.  Please double-check that your Container Images have been successfully pushed to your Container Registry and deploy the application to your Kyma Cluster by running the following command.

    > **Important** - Please ensure you are connected to the correct Kyma Cluster by running _kubectl cluster-info_.

    ```sh
    # Run in ./(multi/single)-tenant/deploy/kyma #
    helm install <ReleaseName> ./charts -f ./charts/values-private.yaml -n <Namespace>

    # Example
    helm install aisaas ./charts -f ./charts/values-private.yaml -n default
    ```

4.  This will take a while, so wait for the process to finish successfully and also check in the **Kyma Dashboard** if all service instances have been created successfully.

## SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime

As the application components are part of the deployment archive in the Cloud Foundry scenario, the process is fairly simple compared to the Kyma deployment, requiring you to specify your Container Image details used by Helm

1. Once your Multi-Target Application Archive is built, please ensure you are logged in to your target Cloud Foundry Space by running the following command. (Re-)Login if required.

   > **Hint** - In this tutorial we assume a basic understanding of the Cloud Foundry deployment process. Please make sure you successfully installed the **Cloud Foundry CLI** in your development environment before you continue.

   ```sh
   # Check target Org and Space #
   cf target

   # (Re-)Login if required #
   cf login -a "https://api.cf.<Region>.hana.ondemand.com"
   ```

2. Make sure you have the MultiApps CF CLI Plugin installed.

> **Hint** - You can find further details on the following website [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multiapps-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multiapps-cli-plugin).

```
cf install-plugin multiapps
```

3. Start the deployment to Cloud Foundry, by running the following command.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./(multi/single)-tenant/deploy/cf #
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. The deployment process will take a while. Wait for the process to finish successfully and also check in the **SAP BTP Cockpit** if all service instances have been created successfully.
