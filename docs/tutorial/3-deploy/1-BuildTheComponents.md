# Build the components

Depending on your target runtime, different build and deployment steps are required. Please follow the corresponding instructions for your chosen runtime.

- [Build the components](#build-the-components)
  - [SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](#sap-btp-kyma-runtime)
  - [SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime](#sap-btp-cloud-foundry-runtime)
    - [Multitenant](#multitenant)
    - [Single-Tenant](#single-tenant)

## SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

In the following steps, you will build the container images for the components of this sample scenario used by helm during the installation to your SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime.

> **Important** - Please make sure you have the respective tools installed in your development environment such as **helm**, **Docker** and **kubectl**. To push your Container Images, please login to your Container Registry!

> **Hint** - In this tutorial we assume a basic understanding of the Kyma deployment process. If you are not familiar with deployment of Kyma solutions, please refer to our [Multitenant SaaS Sample Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-multitenant-saas/#readme) or follow the respective [SAP Developer Journey](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/deliver-side-by-side-extensibility-based-on-sap-btp-kyma-runtime) to learn the basics and get your setup ready.

1. If not done yet, please (fork and) clone the repository to your development environment.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-genai-rag
   cd btp-cap-genai-rag
   ```

2. Please switch to the _(single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma_ directory.

   ```sh
   cd (single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma
   ```

3. Make sure you have the required TypeScript dependencies installed globally.

   ```sh
   npm i -g typescript ts-node
   ```

4. Run the following command to build the CAP components of your application.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./(single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma #
   npm run build
   ```

5. Please run the following command to build the SAPUI5 app components.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./(single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma #
   npm run ui:apps
   ```

6. Please run the following command to build the Container Images. Please set your Container Image Prefix as depicted below.

   > **Hint** - If you use e.g. DockerHub as a Container Registry, please put in your **username** (e.g., johndoe) as Container Image Prefix placeholder. If you use the GitHub Container Registry, the prefix will look similar to **ghcr.io/\<namespace>** (e.g. ghcr.io/johndoe). All generated Docker Images will be automatically prefixed with this label!

   > **Hint** - Using devices with ARM chips (e.g., Apple M1) the build process involving Cloud Native Buildpacks might take several minutes. Please do not immediately cancel the build if things appear to be stuck, but wait some time for the process to continue (especially while the SBOM is being generated)!

   ```sh
   # Run in ./(single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma #
   npx cross-env IMAGE_PREFIX=<ContainerImagePrefix> npm run build:all

   # Example
   npx cross-env IMAGE_PREFIX=sap-demo npm run build:all
   ```

7. Once your Container Images are built, please push them to your container registry by running the following command.

   > **Hint** - If you use e.g. DockerHub as a Container Registry, please put in your **username** (e.g., johndoe) as Container Image Prefix placeholder. If you use the GitHub Container Registry, the prefix will look similar to **ghcr.io/\<namespace>** (e.g. ghcr.io/johndoe). All generated Docker Images will be automatically prefixed with this label!

   ```sh
   # Run in ./(single/multi)-tenant/deploy/kyma #
   npx cross-env IMAGE_PREFIX=<ContainerImagePrefix> npm run push:all

   # Example
   npx cross-env IMAGE_PREFIX=sap-demo npm run push:all
   ```

8. Once your Container Images are successfully pushed, you can continue deploying your application.

## SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime

In the following steps, you will build a multi-target application which can be deployed to your SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime.

### Multitenant

1. If not done yet, please (fork and) clone the repository to your development environment.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-genai-rag
   ```

2. Please switch to the _multi-tenant/deploy/cf_ directory.

   ```sh
   cd multi-tenant/deploy/cf
   ```

3. Make sure you have the required TypeScript dependencies installed globally.

   ```sh
   npm i -g typescript ts-node
   ```

4. Make sure you have the Cloud MTA Build Tool (MBT) installed globally.

   ```sh
   npm install -g mbt
   ```

5. Run the following command to generate unique Service Plan Ids for your Service Broker.

   > **Hint** - Using the **-private** file name extension, these Ids will not be committed to GitHub.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./multi-tenant/deploy/cf #
   cp ../../code/broker/catalog.json ../../code/broker/catalog-private.json
   npx --yes -p @sap/sbf gen-catalog-ids ../../code/broker/catalog-private.json
   ```

6. Run the following command to create a new Service Broker password. Please copy the generated plaintext password and hashed credentials and store them in a secure place!

   ```sh
   # Run in ./multi-tenant/deploy/cf #
   npx --yes -p @sap/sbf hash-broker-password -b
   ```

7. Please duplicate the **free-tier.mtaext** file in the **multi-tenant/deploy/cf/mtaext** directory and add the **-private** suffix before the file name extension, so that you have a second file called **free-tier-private.mtaext**. Adding the **-private** suffix will ensure this file is not committed to GitHub.

8. Open the **free-tier-private.mtaext** file and replace the placeholder "\<paste your hash credentials here\>" with your **hashed credentials** value created a few steps ago. Your mtaext file should look similar to the following.

   ```
   ID: aisaas.freetier
   _schema-version: 3.2.0
   version: 1.0.0
   extends: aisaas

   modules:
      - name: aisaas-api-sb
         properties:
            SBF_BROKER_CREDENTIALS_HASH:  >
            {
               "broker-user": "sha256:0vsw3...bPwNwUc9WM=:5osh6/uiq...LcE9T0="
            }
            SBF_CATALOG_FILE: ./catalog-private.json
   ```

9. Please run the following command to build your **mtar** file.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./multi-tenant/deploy/cf #
   npm run build:mbt
   ```

10. Once your Multi-Target Application Archive is built successfully, you can continue deploying your application ([click here](../3-deploy/2-DeployTheApplication.md)).

### Single-Tenant

1. If not done yet, please (fork and) clone the repository to your development environment.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-genai-rag
   ```

2. Please switch to the _single-tenant/deploy/cf_ directory.

   ```sh
   cd single-tenant/deploy/cf
   ```

3. Make sure you have the required TypeScript dependencies installed globally.

   ```sh
   npm i -g typescript ts-node
   ```

4. Please duplicate the **free-tier.mtaext** file in the **single-tenant/deploy/cf/mtaext** directory and add the **-private** suffix before the file name extension, so that you have a second file called **free-tier-private.mtaext**.

   > **Hint** - Adding the **-private** suffix will ensure this file is not committed to GitHub.

5. Please run the following command to build your **mtar** file.

   ```sh
   # Run in ./single-tenant/deploy/cf #
   npm run build:mbt
   ```

6. Once your Multi-Target Application Archive is built successfully, you can continue deploying your application ([click here](../3-deploy/2-DeployTheApplication.md)).
